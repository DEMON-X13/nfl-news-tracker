/* ---------- per-team matchup preview: the game from that team's angle ---------- */
const MU = {
SEA:["<strong>Beat New England 13-10</strong> at Lumen Field in the Wednesday opener, a far tighter game than the 29-13 Super Bowl.","The matchup they had to win was their front against a Patriots line they shredded in February. They did, but only just.","Neither offense reached 14 in a game the market set at 44.5. The defense carried it, which is the identity."],
NE:["<strong>Lost 13-10 at Seattle</strong> as 3.5-point underdogs, holding the champions to 13 on the road.","OC Josh McDaniels promised the rematch would be different. It was, though 10 points is not a breakout for the new-look offense.","A.J. Brown's debut came against a rebuilt Seattle secondary that was supposed to be the soft spot. It did not break open."],
SF:["<strong>Beat the Rams 27-7</strong> in Melbourne in front of 100,021, the seventh-largest regular season crowd in NFL history.","The winning factor was preparation. They flew in a week early to acclimate while the Rams landed 28 hours before kickoff.","Purdy threw three touchdowns to three receivers, Renardo Green picked off Stafford, and they ran for 174 yards."],
LAR:["<strong>Lost 27-7 to San Francisco</strong> in Melbourne, the Super Bowl favorite losing by 20 in the opener.","Stafford went 4 of 11 in the first half and did not finish the game, pulled while down 20. Kyren Williams scored the only touchdown.","The travel call is the story. McVay says arriving 28 hours out was not the reason, but nearly every analyst disagrees."],
CHI:["<strong>At Carolina as a 3-point favorite.</strong> The NFL.com panel split 3-2 for Chicago with every projected score inside four points.","The matchup that decides it: Ben Johnson's offense against an Evero defense that spent big on Jaelan Phillips and Devin Lloyd.","The edge is Carolina's tackles. Both starters are out and co-sack leader Nic Scourton tore his ACL, so the pass rush is down a man."],
CAR:["<strong>Home against Chicago,</strong> a 3-point underdog in a game two of five NFL.com pickers took them to win outright.","The path is disruption. If Evero's rebuilt front never lets Caleb Williams settle, this swings home.","The counter-argument is Chicago's defense allowed the fourth-most yards in the league and lived on takeaways, which rarely repeats."],
TB:["<strong>At Cincinnati</strong> in the projected shootout of the week, a 50.5 total and the highest on the board.","The matchup is Tampa's thin secondary against Burrow, Chase, Higgins, and Chase Brown. That is the hardest draw available.","One of five NFL.com pickers took Tampa. The case is that Rueben Bain gives the pass rush a real answer immediately."],
CIN:["<strong>Home against Tampa Bay,</strong> favored by 3.5 with four of five pickers on Cincinnati.","Burrow's first regular season game since the injury that cost him nine starts, behind a line that is still the unresolved question.","The winning factor is whether the rebuilt front around Dexter Lawrence buys enough of a buffer. Analysts think it just barely does."],
NO:["<strong>At Detroit as a 6.5-point underdog.</strong> All five NFL.com pickers took the Lions by an average of 12.","The one path: Tyler Shough against a Detroit secondary missing both starting safeties, with Terrion Arnold traded away.","Working against it, Shough took sacks at an 8.3 percent rate last season and will be throwing from behind into Aidan Hutchinson."],
DET:["<strong>Home against New Orleans,</strong> the softest matchup on the early schedule and a unanimous panel pick.","Ford Field is the edge. Detroit has been the league's highest-scoring home team in three of the last four seasons.","The winning factor is the offensive line against a New Orleans front analysts describe as underwhelming. New OC Drew Petzing debuts."],
ATL:["<strong>At Pittsburgh, now starting Cooper Rush</strong> after Tua Tagovailoa was ruled out Friday with an oblique.","The matchup to survive: RT Jawaan Taylor against Watt, Highsmith, and Herbig. ESPN predicts Taylor grades under a 75 percent pass block win rate against a 90 percent average.","Unanimous against them. Stefanski was 6-7 versus Pittsburgh in Cleveland, which is the most encouraging number available."],
PIT:["<strong>Home against Atlanta,</strong> favored by 3.5 with all five NFL.com pickers on Pittsburgh.","McCarthy and Rodgers reunite in Rodgers' first game, and he took zero preseason snaps. Rust is the live variable.","The edge is stark: Atlanta's pass rush is missing Jalon Walker to injury and James Pearce Jr. to suspension, so Rodgers should have time."],
BUF:["<strong>At Houston,</strong> a 1.5-point favorite in a game four of five pickers took the home underdog.","The history is ugly. Houston has won four of the last five against Allen's Bills, holding him to a career-low 30 percent completions in 2024 and eight sacks in 2025, both in Houston.","Joe Brady runs a team and calls plays for the first time at any level, against Will Anderson Jr. and the best defense in football."],
HOU:["<strong>Home against Buffalo</strong> as a 1.5-point underdog that most of the NFL.com panel picked to win anyway.","The matchup is the whole game: the league's best defense against the preseason MVP favorite. DeMeco Ryans has owned this before.","Their counter to Cook and D.J. Moore is a front that produced a DSRS of 7.2, best in the conference outright."],
BAL:["<strong>At Indianapolis,</strong> favored by 3.5 in Jesse Minter's head coaching debut.","Minter gets an immediate rematch with the offense that hung 38 on his Chargers in Week 7, the most Los Angeles allowed all season.","The question the league is asking: does Lamar Jackson have his swagger back under new OC Declan Doyle after an injury-plagued 2025?"],
IND:["<strong>Home against Baltimore</strong> as a 3.5-point underdog, with one of five pickers taking the Colts.","Daniel Jones plays his first game since tearing his Achilles in December. Rust is expected and priced in.","The edge is Sauce Gardner against a Ravens receiving group, and a Baltimore staff installing a brand new offense."],
CLE:["<strong>At Jacksonville as an 8.5-point underdog,</strong> the second-biggest spread of the week and a unanimous panel pick against.","There is no obvious path. Deshaun Watson starts despite being outplayed by Shedeur Sanders in the preseason.","The receiver room depends on rookies KC Concepcion and Denzel Boston against a defense with playmakers at every level."],
JAX:["<strong>Home against Cleveland,</strong> favored by 8.5 with the lowest total on the board at 40.5.","Trevor Lawrence enters year two in Coen's system with a loaded pass-catching group against a Browns defense without Myles Garrett.","The only real risk is the one that follows them all season: a 13-win jump built partly on takeaway luck that rarely repeats."],
NYJ:["<strong>At Tennessee as a 1.5-point underdog,</strong> and every NFL.com picker took the Jets anyway.","Geno Smith and the starters flourished in limited preseason action while Cam Ward's first unit struggled. That is the case.","The trap is the Titans front: ex-Jets Jermaine Johnson II and John Franklin-Myers alongside Jeffery Simmons, all motivated."],
TEN:["<strong>Home against the Jets,</strong> favored by 1.5 in the lowest-total game of the week at 38.5.","Robert Saleh's first game as a head coach comes against the team that fired him, with Aaron Glenn on the other sideline.","Neither of these teams has won a Week 1 game since 2021 outside the Rodgers four-snap opener. A win here is rare and worth a lot."],
MIA:["<strong>At Las Vegas,</strong> a 3.5-point underdog in one of only six games in 30 seasons with both head coaches making their NFL debut.","Several outlets call this Miami's best chance at a win all season, and most still have them losing by at least a touchdown.","The matchup to survive is Maxx Crosby against a line protecting Malik Willis in his first year as a full-time starter."],
LV:["<strong>Home against Miami,</strong> favored by 3.5, and the home coach has won three of the previous five debut-versus-debut meetings.","The plan is simple: make Willis beat them through the air, which is the hardest ask on Miami's roster.","Working against it, Brock Bowers had a meniscus trim Tuesday and is out a game or two, removing the best receiving threat on the roster."],
WAS:["<strong>At Philadelphia as a 5.5-point underdog,</strong> a unanimous panel pick against and Sirianni is 5-0 in Week 1.","The matchup is brutal: a Tunsil-less line against the Carter and Davis interior, which analysts call a recipe for disaster.","Philadelphia also has the personnel to contain Daniels specifically, with Baun and Campbell to track him and two All-Pro corners to close lanes."],
PHI:["<strong>Home divisional opener,</strong> favored by 5.5 with all five NFL.com pickers on Philadelphia.","The first game of the post A.J. Brown era, with DeVonta Smith as the No. 1 and a new play caller in Sean Mannion.","The edge is the front against a Washington line that lost Laremy Tunsil to a torn triceps on August 8."],
ARI:["<strong>At the Chargers as a 9.5-point underdog,</strong> the biggest spread on the board and projected as the most lopsided result outside Jacksonville.","Mike LaFleur's first game as a head coach comes in the building where he spent three years as the Rams' coordinator.","The realistic shape: a big Chargers halftime lead that narrows as Brissett, McBride, and Wilson play well from behind, which they did all last season."],
LAC:["<strong>Home against Arizona,</strong> favored by 9.5 and unanimously picked in what should be the cleanest win of the week.","Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater are both back, and this is Mike McDaniel's first game calling plays here.","The one soft spot: rookie center Jake Slaughter makes his first career start against Walter Nolen and Josh Sweat, with Biadasz out."],
GB:["<strong>At Minnesota as a 1.5-point underdog,</strong> the closest line among divisional games.","This is about what Green Bay lost. Micah Parsons is out four games and Josh Jacobs is on the commissioner exempt list.","A backfield of Lloyd, Kaleb Johnson, and Chris Brooks means Flores can plan for a heavy dose of Love's arm and scheme accordingly."],
MIN:["<strong>Home against Green Bay,</strong> favored by 1.5 with four of five pickers on Minnesota.","Kyler Murray's debut under Kevin O'Connell in a full U.S. Bank Stadium. Sharp is explicitly higher on Minnesota with him starting.","The edge is Flores against a Packers run game with one back who has more than 100 career rushing yards."],
DAL:["<strong>At the Giants on Sunday night,</strong> favored by 2.5 in the 128th meeting of a rivalry Dallas has won 16 of the last 18 times since 2017.","Two overhauled defenses. Dallas rebuilt from dead last in scoring defense with Downs, Lawrence, Gary, and Williams under new DC Christian Parker.","The complication arrived this week: Pro Bowl LG Tyler Smith needs thumb surgery and misses 4 to 6 weeks against a scary Giants front."],
NYG:["<strong>Home on Sunday night as a 2.5-point underdog,</strong> with one of five pickers calling it Big Blue's Super Bowl.","Harbaugh's first game. Skattebo is healthy, Nabers may return, Beckham is back, and Arvell Reese joins an already scary pass rush.","The opening: Dallas lost LG Tyler Smith to thumb surgery, throwing TJ Bass into the fire against that rush."],
DEN:["<strong>At Kansas City on Monday night,</strong> a 2.5-point underdog that three of five NFL.com pickers took to win outright.","The whole week points here: is Mahomes all the way back? He has not formally been cleared and took no preseason snaps.","The matchup is Denver's intact defense, 311 points allowed last year, against a Chiefs line that will not have Josh Simmons at tackle."],
KC:["<strong>Home on Monday night,</strong> favored by 2.5 in Mahomes' first game since tearing his ACL and LCL in December.","Expect a run-heavy script early behind Kenneth Walker III to ease him back in, in a game with a 43.5 total.","The regression argument cuts both ways. Denver won eleven one-score games last year and Kansas City lost nine, and both numbers should move toward the middle."]
